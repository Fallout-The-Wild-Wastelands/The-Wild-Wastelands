# The Wild Wastelands

## Development Plans

| **Topic** | **Status** | **Notes** |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Food & Water | **Completed** | This is fully implemented! |
| Pipboys | Removed | Pipboys were removed at the start of the redesign as they are an inefficient inventory manager for Roblox gameplay. |
| Shift Lock | Removed | Shift Lock being permanently enabled made many people quit because it's honestly such an ugly way to control the camera in Third Person. |
| Looting | Work in Progress | Loot will now behave as it does in Fallout 76 rather than all items dropping in a pile upon death, changes also come to how loot spawns around the map which is now in containers rather than being on the floor.
| Building | Work in Progress | |
| Interiors | Work in Progress | |
| NPC Securitrons | Work in Progress | We're awaiting completion of the Weaponry and Combat to continue with NPCs. |
| NPC Ghouls | Work in Progress | We're awaiting completion of the Weaponry and Combat to continue with NPCs. |
| Armours | Work in Progress | |
| Gambling | Unstarted | We are still reviewing how gambling can be made effective for the gameplay loop. |
| Radiation & Environmental Damage | Unstarted | |
| Weaponry & Combat | Unstarted | |
| Game Lighting | Unstarted | We're awaiting the completion of the map before we add dynamic lighting systems. |
| Faction Build Kits & Perks | Unstarted | |
| Medicines | Unstarted | These will only be the non-drug chems from the Fallout games. |
| Game Audio | Unstarted | We're aware how boring games can get when there is no background ambience and reactivity. |
